## Project Description
> A program that Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25.
  This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th
  next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".

## Project Overview

| Behaviour     | Example Input | Example Output  |
 | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
 | User types in a single letter and a key(number)   | "D",5  | "I"  |
 | For every character entered, it's position should change with the number of key  | "ABC",1  | "BCD"  |
 | Each character in a sentence should shift forward by the number of the shift key  | "I am happy",2  | "K co jcrra"  |
 | Shift key must be in range 1-25  | "A",50  | Asks for input again  |
 | Return nothing when empty string is submitted  | "",2  | ""  |
 | Encrypt lower and uppercase letters appropriately  | "A caT",1  | "B dbU"  |
 | Ensure looping through the alphabet shift  | "Z",1  | "A"  |
