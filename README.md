## Project Description
> A program that Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25.
  This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th
  next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".

## Project Overview

| Behaviour     | Example Input | Example Output  |
 | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
 | Program needs to compile and run the code  | User types into the terminal javac App.java && java App | program runs and asks for user input |
 | Program asks the user for a letter and a step value  | "D",5  | encrypts to "I" and decrypts "I" back to "D" |
 | Program needs to compile and run the code for the next test | User types into the terminal javac App.java && java App | program runs and asks for user input |
 | For every character entered, it's position should change with the number of key  | "ABC",6 | Encypts to  "GHI" and decrypts to "ABC"  |
 | Shift key must be in range 1-25  | "B",28  | Returns the value at 28 - 25  |
 | Return nothing when empty string is submitted  | "", 27  | ""  |
 | Encrypt & Decrypts lower and uppercase letters to uppercase | "abcD", 6  | Encrypts to "GHIJ" and decrypts to "ABCD" |
 | Loops through the entire alphabet correctly | "Z",1  and "A", 25 | "A" and "Z" respectively |
